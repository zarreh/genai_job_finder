Our suite of tools includes Aha! Roadmaps, Aha! Discovery, Aha! Ideas, Aha! Whiteboards, Aha! Knowledge, Aha! Teamwork, and Aha! Develop. Product teams rely on our expertise, guided templates, and training programs via Aha! Academy to be their best. We are proud to be a very different type of high-growth SaaS company. The business is self-funded, profitable, and 100% remote. We are recognized as one of the best fully remote companies to work for, champion the Bootstrap Movement, and have given over $1M to people in need through Aha! Cares. Learn more at www.aha.io.\n\nOur team\n\nThe Aha! engineering team is a midsized, fully remote group that is highly productive. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.\n\n• We help each other grow: We each bring unique skills to the table and want our teammates to feel valued from the start. Our onboarding program exposes new hires to the codebase and lets them contribute right away.\n• We move quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting valuable features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.\n• We value product over process: We want the team to have the time and focus needed to solve complex challenges. We minimize overhead by setting clear goals and avoiding heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.\n• We share knowledge freely: We share our learnings with one another and with the developer community. Our engineering blog demonstrates how we tackle interesting challenges at Aha!\n• We enjoy: We like what we do. And we want you to love your team and your job too. Learn more about The Responsive Method, our company values, and the generous benefits we offer.\n\nOur technology\n\nOur web application is a single-instance, multitenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and Memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.\n\nWe use a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies: Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.\n\nTeammates embrace the new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product suite, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us — rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that might never materialize.\n\nWe do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so software engineers and their teams can take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)\n\nYour experience\n\nMost of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should be familiar with working in a Rails codebase. You will perform security code reviews and should have experience reviewing code for security, compliance, or functional validation. Overall, you have strong problem-solving abilities as well as experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product.\n\nSkills\n\nWe believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again. You also have the following experience and skills:\n\n• Four+ years of experience working in Ruby on Rails\n• Experience with code reviews for security or functional validation in Ruby on Rails\n• Experience developing features at a high-growth SaaS company\n• Active collaborator with product teams\n\nYour work at Aha!\n\nThe security team works across our full suite of products and applications with a focus on core features such as authentication, authorization, file handling, and data segmentation. We also provide security reviews and guidance for the larger engineering team across the full stack.\n\nWe Love Ruby On Rails And Dig Deep Into Code And Business Logic. As a Sr. Security Engineer, Your Work Will Include\n\n• Implementing security features and improvements with the customer experience in mind\n• Security code reviews that go above and beyond what can be found with scanning tools (which we also use!)\n• Investigating errors to identify security, resiliency, and performance improvements\n• Developing and sharing secure patterns internally for ongoing education\n\nIf this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. A real human reviews every application, so please use the form to help us learn more about you.\n\nGrow with us\n\nEveryone deserves to reach their fullest potential. We know that when we do work that matters with people we care about in a high-growth environment, we feel engaged and alive. It is why we joined Aha! and how we achieve our very best.\n\nWe offer all the benefits you would expect and more, including profit sharing. The specific benefits listed below are reflective of what we offer U.S.-based hires. We also do our best to extend identical benefits to international teammates.\n\n• The base salary range for this role in the U.S. is between $110,000 and $190,000\n• Cash-based compensation also includes profit sharing, and we contribute a percentage of your total pay each month toward your retirement\n• Medical, dental, and vision plans (for many teammates, we cover 100% of the premiums)\n• Up to 200 hours of paid time off a year to spend however you want\n• 30 to 90 days of paid parental leave and five to 10 days of paid care and bereavement leave\n• Up to $1,000 annually for third-party education, along with paid time off to immerse yourself in learning\n• Volunteer opportunities throughout the year\n\nBase salary and total compensation are dependent upon many factors, including skills, experience, and relevant past roles.\n\n Show more\n\n Show less"

Provide data-driven recommendations for securing containers, AMIs, ISOs, packages, and third-party dependencies. Develop dashboards and metrics (e.g., risk scores, patch coverage, remediation timelines) for engineering and leadership. Document workflows and enable other teams to use AI/automation in supply chain security. QualificationsDOD Clearance Eligibility.
