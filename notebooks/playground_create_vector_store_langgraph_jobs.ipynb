Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-perfect credit scores or no scores at all. We decided this just wouldn’t do.In partnership with our sponsor banks, we offer credit cards under the Mission Lane brand name, with better, clearer terms, and a more refined customer experience than the alternatives available to people working hard to improve their credit.To date, over four million consumers have chosen Mission Lane, earning high customer ratings on Credit Karma for its market segment and industry leading Net Promoter scores.Mission Lane has cumulatively raised over $600 million of equity from leading investors, including Invus Opportunities, QED Investors, LL Funds, funds affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management, and other leading investors.Interested in learning more? Check out The Mission Lane Junction for articles on culture, credit, and community, and The Mission Lane Newsroom for media mentions.At Mission Lane, we’re committed to a workplace built on respect and dignity, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute. We believe diversity in all forms makes us stronger, and we intentionally foster an inclusive environment where employees feel valued, respected, and free to be their true selves.
